![read_me_banner](https://github.com/nabilBouzineDev/RecipesListApp/assets/139881384/bca163e7-e8fc-4cd7-8e0a-08ef79070f4e)

 I implement in this demo app all concepets I've learned in google codelabs such as: 
   - _**creating a low-fidelity prototype**_
   - _**composition & recomposition**_
   - _**state hoisting**_
   - _**basic compose layouts**_
   - **_buttons click behavior_**.
   - **_Use Lazy Columns to make a list_**.
   - **_Add animations_**.

 # Resources
 The main resource to get started with this project:
   
   - [Project: Create a 30 Days App ](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-30-days)

# Prerequisites
  It's recommended to have these _**prerequisites**_ for completing this project:

   1. Ability to create and run a project in Android Studio.
   2. Experience with Kotlin syntax, collections, and classes.
   3. Ability to apply basic Jetpack Compose concepts.
   4. Experience with composable functions, which includes Card, Text, Image, and Button composables.

# Low-Fi

  - I made a simple model that provides me a basic idea of what the app looks like. Then, I divide this drawing into sections to identify which **_composables_** I'll use.

  - Later on, I design the UI on how the app will look like using **_Figma_**.

  - Finally, I make the logic and layout of the app using **_Kotlin_** and **_Jetpack Compose_** library.

# Disclaimer
- I made this app for **educational** purposes only & all content can be found in this [article.](https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7824602/30-days-of-recipes-to-get-you-back-to-healthy)
- I supposed to add 30 meals here. However, since I accomplish the required UI and logic, there's no need to add more...
